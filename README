The goal of this project was to compare the use of the PageRank and HITS network analysis algorithms in determining the highest ranked airports in the US.

The algorithms use the concept of Graph theory to analyse the relationships between airports linked by flights and rank airports based on their flight connections to other airports within th enetwork.
